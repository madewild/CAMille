    <tr>
        <td><b>Phrase search</b></td>
        <td>When you want to query a document for multiple terms appearing next to each other, you can add quotes. 
            For example, the query "washington dc" will match documents containing those two terms next to each other, 
            in the same order. The phrase search can be combined with the following search functions.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Wildcards</b></td>
        <td>'?' matches a single character. For example, wom?n will match documents containing "women" or "woman". 
            '*' matches one or several characters. For example, balti* will match documents containing "baltic", "baltique" or "baltikum". 
            This tool may or may not work as it is very expensive to run.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Fuzzy search</b></td>
        <td>It is based on the Damereau-Levenshtein distance and allows the querying of syntaxically similar terms. 
            The maximum default distance is set to 2. For example, the query roam~ will match documents containing terms 
            like "roam" and "foam" but not "roast". The distance between "roast" and "roam" is 3 (two deletions and one addition). 
            It is possible to set the maximum distance to 1 using the following syntax : roam~1
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Proximity search</b></td>
        <td>It is sometimes useful to query documents for words appearing close to one another. 
            For example, the query "woman pants"~10 will match documents containing those two terms, separated by 10 words at most.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Term boosting</b></td>
        <td>You can affect the way the pertinence of documents is computed (and thus the order of the results) 
            by specifying the importance of the terms in the query. For example, the query president roosevelt^2 
            will affect the score by giving the term "roosevelt" twice as much importance as the term "president". 
            It is also possible to negatively affect the importance of a term by specifying a number between 0 and 1 
            (for example president^0.5 roosevelt is the equivalent to the previous query).
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Boolean NOT</b></td>
        <td>To query for documents that should not contain a particular term or phrase, you can prepend it with the '-' symbol. 
            For example, the query president -roosevelt will return documents containing the term "president" but not the term "roosevelt".
